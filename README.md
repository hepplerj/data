This repository contains a selection of the data and data-processing scripts behind the visualizations, articles, research, and interactives built and written by [me](http://jasonheppler.org). See individual folders for additional documentation.

My hope is people will use this to check my work and create their own visualizations.

This is a work-in-progress. Data, scripts, and README's will be added when time permits.
